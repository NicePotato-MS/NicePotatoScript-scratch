Welcome to NicePotatoScript's documentation!
=========================================

**NicePotatoScript (NPS)** is a text-based programming language made for scratch.
It takes your program (text-form) and compiles it into a scratch project (sb3)
I may expand PotatoScript into an independent language in the future, but right now it's for Scratch.

Check out the :doc:`/syntax/syntax-index` for language syntax
